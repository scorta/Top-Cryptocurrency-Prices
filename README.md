# [Top Cryptocurrency Prices](https://9corn.com)

This repo acts like hosting for https://9corn.com - Update top cryptocurrency prices every ~15 minutes.

## How does this work?

I write a program to monitor & calculate stats of top cryptocurrency prices (that run from a local machine), and every ~15 minutes, it pushes the result (`index.html` file) into this GitHub repo.
